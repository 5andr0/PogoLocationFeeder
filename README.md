# PogoLocationFeeder
Json feed of pokemon location data for sniper bots like [NecroBot](https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot)

We have been contacted by Discord regarding server load issues. They will be blocking old bot accounts, and new feed requests have been migrated to a centralized server to allow for better traffic control. We will be opening up donations toward hosting a dedicated server, aimed at providing correct feed outputs for pokemon moves, IVs, and expiration dates.
